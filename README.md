# Spin Python SDK

**This repository has been archived.  New development is happening in [the spin-python-sdk repo](https://github.com/fermyon/spin-python-sdk).**

This is an SDK for creating [Spin](https://github.com/fermyon/spin) apps using Python.

Note that this SDK supercedes an earlier, experimental version, which may be
found in the [old-sdk](https://github.com/fermyon/spin-python-sdk/tree/old-sdk)
branch.
